<h2>Exporting</h2>
<p>ExpressViews can be used as a starting point to quickly add fields to a 
report, before delving into some of the more Advanced Reporting capabilities. 
The ExpressView format is not compatible with the Report Designer, but you can 
export it to an <a class="topic-link" href="reportdesigner.htm">Advanced 
Report</a> and edit the copy.</p>
<p>To export an ExpressView to an Advanced Report:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="list_123">Click the <strong>Settings <img src="../Media/SettingsMenu.png" alt="" /> </strong>icon. 
  </li><li class="list_123">Click the <strong>Create Advanced Report </strong>tab. 
  </li><li class="list_123">Enter a name for the report and select a folder where it 
  should live. 
  </li><li class="list_123">Click <strong>Create Advanced Report</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>If you to save an ExpressView as a file, it is exported as PDF, RTF, CSV, or 
Excel. Each format has some advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="list_bullets">PDF is closest to the look of the ExpressView, and is 
  suitable for printing and emailing. But if there is a large amount of data, 
  you may have too many pages, or too large a file size. 
  </li><li class="list_bullets">RTF retains the basic look of the ExpressView, and can 
  be opened in a word processor for any additional editing. But it may look 
  different depending on the program it is viewed with, and it is not suitable 
  for viewing large amounts of data. 
  </li><li class="list_bullets">CSV retains only the data, and none of the look of the 
  ExpressView. It is best used if you need to process a large amount of data in 
  an accounting or analysis program. 
  </li><li class="list_bullets">Excel retains the data, visualization, and optionally, 
  some styling. It is a good hybrid format if you have a lot of data, but you 
  still need it in a visually presentable form. </li></ul>
<p class="Aside"><strong>Export settings</strong></p>
<p>You can make some customizations to the appearance that the exported files 
will take. With the Settings page open, click the <strong>Export Settings 
</strong>tab to see the available options:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="list_bullets">
  <p><strong>Page Options </strong>affect the size which PDF, RTF, and Excel 
  exports will show on a screen and in print.</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p><strong>General Options</strong> allow you to restrict available export 
  types, and choose a default type.</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p><strong>Other Options</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="list_bullets">
    <p><strong>Include Setup Info</strong>: Choose whether to include some 
    information about the fields, sorts, and filters in the body of the 
file.</p>
    </li><li class="list_bullets">
    <p><strong>Use Group Color Styling</strong>: Choose whether to include the 
    group header colorings in the output file.</p>
    </li><li class="list_bullets">
    <p><strong>'No Data Qualified' Mode</strong>: If the ExpressView returns no 
    data, choose whether to render an empty file, or show a user message 
    instead.</p>
    </li><li class="list_bullets">
    <p><strong>Flatten Groups in Excel and CSV</strong>: For Excel and CSV 
    files, choose whether to automatically ungroup, or <em>flatten</em>, all 
    group columns into data columns. This may make the output more suitable for 
    data analysis.</p>
    </li><li class="list_bullets">
    <p><strong>Keep Cell Styling in Excel</strong>: For Excel files, choose 
    whether to show styling, such as font and row shading, or to show only the 
    bare data.</p></li></ul></li></ul><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
