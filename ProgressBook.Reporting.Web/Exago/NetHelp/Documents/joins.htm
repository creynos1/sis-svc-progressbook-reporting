<h2>Joins</h2>
<p class="Caution"><strong><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.caution.png" /> Caution<br /></strong>The <strong>Joins 
</strong>window is recommended for <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">advanced users</span> only.</p>
<p>Joins describe how the categories on a report are related to each other. When 
two categories are joined, a field in the first category is associated with a 
field in the second category. Wherever a value in the first category's field 
matches a value in the second category's field, that value's rows from each 
category come together to form a composite row. The table produced by all the 
composite rows is the resulting data that appears on the report.</p>
<p>For example, take the following categories, Orders and Products. The 
Orders.ProductId field corresponds with the Products.Id field. When the 
categories are joined from Orders.ProductId to Products.Id, the rows are 
connected wherever those two fields have matching values.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.joins_basic_demo.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Categories joined on <span class="Code">Orders.ProductId &gt;&gt; Products.Id</span></p>
<p>The result of this join is the following composite rows. These categories 
have a <em>one-to-one </em><a class="topic-link" href="joins.htm#relationshiptypes.htm">relationship</a>, because each row in the 
"left" category joins <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">at most 
one</span> row in the "right" category.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.joins_basic_row.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Joined categories. Products.Id is omitted.</p>
<p class="Tip"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.tip.png" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br />Categories could be 
joined along more than one set of fields; composite rows are formed only when 
all sets have matching values.</p>
<p>For two categories to be copresent on a report, there must be a join path 
between them. They are either directly joined, or there is a path through one or 
more intermediate categories. You do not have to configure joins manually - they 
already exist in the environment. However, if you want to learn how to add or 
adjust joins on a per-report basis, this topic will explain the options that are 
available.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="jointypes.htm" id="jointypes.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Join Types</p>
<p>The join that was previously described is the most common type of join, an 
<em>inner join</em>. When an inner join is applied, rows in either category that 
have no matching row in the other are excluded from the resulting table. 
However, you may not want to exclude these rows. To do so, you can change the 
type of join to an <em>outer join</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the row in the Products category with Id: 12 has no matching row 
in the Orders category. With an inner join, this row is excluded from the 
output. If you want to see the Products rows that have no matching Orders row, 
you can change the join type.</p>
<p>To do so, from the <img alt="" src="../Media/ReportOptions.png" /><strong> Report Options</strong> 
&gt; <strong><img alt="" src="../Media/Advanced.png" /> Advanced</strong> &gt; <strong><img alt="" src="../Media/Join.png" /> Joins</strong> window, select the 
<strong>Products data that does not have Orders data </strong>check box.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.join_type.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Left outer join</p>
<p>This changes the join between these categories to a <em>left outer 
join</em>, because all rows from the <em>left </em>category are included. The 
following rows result:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.joins_left_outer.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Joined categories with all Products rows. Products.Id is 
omitted.</p>
<p>Similarly, selecting the <strong>Orders data that does not have Products 
data</strong> check box changes the join to a <em>right outer join</em>, which 
includes all rows from the <em>right </em>category. Selecting both check boxes 
includes all rows from both categories; this is a <em>full outer 
join</em>.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="relationshiptypes.htm" id="relationshiptypes.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Relationship Types</p>
<p>There are two types of join relationships: <em>one-to-one</em> and 
<em>one-to-many</em>.</p>
<p>In the previous example, the relationship between the categories is 
<em>one-to-one</em>, because each row in the left category joins <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">at most one</span> row in the right category. 
Some categories have a <em>one-to-many</em> relationship, where each row in the 
left category joins <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">zero or more</span> 
rows in the right category.</p>
<p>A one-to-many relationship from categories X to Y is represented in the 
following diagram:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.1M_detail.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Each X is joined to one or more Y</p>
<p>Reports with a single one-to-many join are well suited to <a class="topic-link" href="sections.htm#dynamic.htm">grouping</a> by the left category. The data in 
these reports is generally well-formed and understandable.</p>
<p>However, when a report has multiple categories with one-to-many joins, data 
can appear more disorganized and confusing. For example, the following diagram 
represents data from three categories, X, Y, and Z, where the relationships 
between X - Y and X - Z are both one-to-many:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.1Mx2_detail.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Each X has 1 or more Y, and 1 or more Z<br /></p>
<p>Because Y and Z are not directly related to each other, there are many rows 
with only Y or only Z. This can cause the report to be significantly larger, and 
to be difficult to read and interpret. This occurs even with inner joins, the 
most restrictive type, because by default there is no logic that deals with the 
relationship between Y and Z.</p>
<p>Read on for different ways of improving the structure of a report with 
multiple one-to-many joins.</p>
<p class="Aside">Cartesian Processing</p>
<p>You could fill the blank spaces with supplementary data by disabling 
<strong>Special Cartesian Processing</strong> from the <strong>Joins</strong> 
window. Blank cells are filled in with data that is repeated directly from the 
previous row. The following diagram demonstrates how this works:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.1Mx2_no_cartesian.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Disabling Special Cartesian Processing</p>
<p>The shaded cells represent data that has been repeated from the previous row. 
This can make the report more readable. However, this approach poses a problem: 
Blank cells indicate a lack of a relationship between two fields, so filling in 
these spaces with artificial data can obfuscate any relationship between Y and 
Z. This can decrease the accuracy of the report.</p>
<p>There are better ways to improve the readability of such a report without 
sacrificing accuracy:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="list_bullets">
  <p>Use <a class="topic-link" href="sections.htm#dynamic.htm">repeating 
  groups</a> to show the X - Y and X - Z relationships in entirely separate 
  sections. This is suitable if any relationship between Y and Z is irrelevant 
  or nonexistent. See <a class="topic-link" href="sections.htm">Sections</a> for 
  more information.</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p>Hide some or all of the rows which do not have data for both Y and Z. This 
  is suitable if you want to highlight an implicit or indirect relationship 
  between Y and Z. This is done by imposing <em>Must </em>constraints. Read on 
  for more information.</p></li></ul>
<p class="Aside"><em>Must </em>Constraints</p>
<p>Although Y and Z are not directly joined, they are both related to X, so 
there is an implicit relationship between them. If you examine Y and Z alone, 
you will notice that they technically exhibit a <em>full outer join</em>.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.1Mx2_YZ.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Y and Z, without X</p>
<p>Because all the rows from Y and Z that relate to X are shown, there are rows 
with both Y and Z, or with only one of either. <em>Must</em> 
constraints allow you to change the implicit join type, and in doing so, 
eliminate rows that lack data from one or both categories.</p>
<p>To set <em>Must </em>constraints, from the <strong>Joins 
</strong>window, locate the <strong>MUST</strong> panel for the applicable 
categories:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.join_must.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Setting <span style="FONT-STYLE: normal">Must 
</span>constraints</p>
<p>Do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="list_bullets">
  <p>Select the <strong>Y</strong> check box - <em>Left outer join</em>: Any 
  rows without Z are removed</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p>Select the <strong>Z</strong> check box - <em>Right outer join</em>: 
  Any rows without Y are removed</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">

<p class="MidTopic">Modifying Joins</p>
<p>The <strong>Joins</strong> window shows all direct and implicit joins on the 
report. Direct joins can be added, modified, or removed from the report.</p>
<p>To add a new join:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="list_123">
  <p>Select <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong> categories.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Click <img alt="" src="../Media/Add2.png" /> <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Click <img alt="" src="../Media/Add2.png" /> <strong>Add 
  Condition</strong> then select <strong>From</strong> (left column) and 
  <strong>To</strong> (right column) fields.</p>
  <p class="Tip"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.tip.png" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br />If there are 
  multiple conditions, only the rows that satisfy <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">all</span> the conditions are joined.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Click <strong>Okay</strong>.</p></li></ol>
<p>To remove conditions, click the Delete <img alt="" src="../Media/DeleteItem.png" /> icon next to the condition to delete.</p>
<p>To modify a join's fields:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="list_123">
  <p>Click the Edit <img alt="" src="../Media/Edit.png" /> icon next to the 
  join to edit.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Add, remove, or modify conditions.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Click <strong>Okay</strong>.</p></li></ol>
<p>To remove a join, click the Delete <img alt="" src="../Media/DeleteItem.png" /> icon next to the join to delete, then click 
<strong>Okay</strong>.</p>
<p>To restore the default joins, click <strong><img alt="" src="../Media/Refresh.png" /> Recreate</strong>, then click 
<strong>Okay</strong>.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="advancedjoins.htm" id="advancedjoins.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Advanced Joins</p>
<p>You may be able to specify join conditions that are more complex than column 
equality.</p>
<p class="Aside">Type</p>
<p>Instead of joining between two columns, one or both sides of the join may 
instead be an arbitrary expression, constant, or SQL sub-query that you 
specify.</p>
<p>To change the expression type for one side of a join condition, select one of 
the following from the <strong>Type</strong> list:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="list_bullets">
  <p><strong>Value</strong>: One or more constant values separated by commas</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p><strong>Expression</strong>: Formula or calculation</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p><strong>SubQuery</strong>: SQL query</p></li></ul>
<p>Then enter the value in the <strong>Value</strong> field.</p>
<p class="Aside">Operator</p>
<p>As opposed to the default equality (=) operator, which joins fields from the 
left expression to matching fields from the right expression, a join 
condition can use one of several alternative operators instead. For example, the 
inequality (!=) operator joins fields on the left to non-matching fields on the 
right. To do so, select one of the alternative operators from the 
<strong>Operator</strong> list:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="list_bullets"><strong class="Code">!=</strong> not equal 
  </li><li class="list_bullets"><strong class="Code">&gt; </strong> greater than 
  </li><li class="list_bullets"><strong class="Code">&gt;=</strong> greater than or equal 

  </li><li class="list_bullets"><strong class="Code">&lt; </strong> less than 
  </li><li class="list_bullets"><strong class="Code">&lt;=</strong> less than or equal 
  </li><li class="list_bullets"><strong class="Code">IN</strong> match one or more 
  values, either specified or calculated from a subquery </li></ul>
<p class="Aside">Grouping</p>
<p>When a join has two or more conditions, you can specify how the conditions 
should be met as a group in order for the join to take effect.</p>
<p>To specify that either one of two conditions will satisfy part of the clause, 
select <strong>OR</strong> from the <strong>Conjunction</strong> list for the 
first condition of the two.</p>
<p>To add parentheses around two conditions, select the <strong>Group</strong> 
check box for the first condition of the two.</p>
<p>You can preview the full join clause in the <strong>Summary</strong> 
field.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
