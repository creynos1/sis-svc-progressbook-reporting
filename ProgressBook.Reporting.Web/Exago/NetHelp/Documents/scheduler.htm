<h1>Scheduler</h1>
<p>The scheduler allows you to run reports regularly at specified times. This 
can be useful for reports which are based on periods of time, such as weekly 
sales reports or quarterly earnings reports.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="makingaschedule.htm" id="makingaschedule.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Making a schedule</p>

  <p>Optional: If this is a batch schedule, an <strong>Attach Report Output to

<p>Schedules can be edited after they are created. See <a class="topic-link" href="scheduler.htm#viewingschedules.htm">Viewing schedules</a> for more 
information.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="viewingschedules.htm" id="viewingschedules.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Viewing schedules</p>
<p>To see the schedules that have been created click the <strong>Schedule 
Manager <img src="../Media/MainLeftPaneScheduleManager.png" alt="" /> </strong>icon. Each 
schedule is on a row with its most recent and forthcoming run times, and a 
status indicating its condition:</p>
<p><span class="Option">Ready</span></p>
<p class="Indent">The schedule will run on its next run time.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Running</span></p>
<p class="Indent">The schedule is currently running.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Transmitting</span></p>
<p class="Indent">The scheduled event has finished running, and the report is 
being sent to the user.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Completed</span></p>
<p class="Indent">The schedule has completed its final event, and will not run 
again. It will be removed from the list when the cache is flushed.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Deleted</span></p>
<p class="Indent">The schedule has been deleted, and will be removed from the list 
when the cache is flushed.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Abended</span></p>
<p class="Indent">The last run failed due to an error. The schedule will not run 
again.</p>
<p><span class="Option">User Aborted</span></p>
<p class="Indent">The schedule is running, but it was requested to be canceled. It 
will be marked as Deleted.</p>
<p>Scheduled events which have passed are copied to an archive row, so that 
there is a log of previous run times. Such events are labeled <span class="Code">(archive)</span>. Deleting these rows will not affect the main 
schedule.</p>
<p>Schedules which are associated with a cached report are labeled <span class="Code">(cache)</span>. See <a class="topic-link" href="executioncaching.htm">Execution Caching</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Completed and canceled schedules and archives may be periodically removed 
from the list. Click <img src="../Media/Flush.png" alt="" /> <strong>Flush 
</strong>to remove them immediately.</p>
<p class="Aside"><strong>Managing schedules</strong></p>
<p>To edit an existing schedule click the <strong>Edit <img src="../Media/Edit.png" alt="" /> </strong>icon. Changes to the recurrence pattern will 
affect all forthcoming run times. You can reuse or reset deleted or completed 
schedules by editing them. This will set their status to Ready.</p>
<p>To delete a schedule click the <strong>Delete <img src="../Media/DeleteItem.png" alt="" /> </strong>icon. This sets its status to Deleted. 
If the schedule is already marked as Deleted, this removes the schedule from the 
list.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="emailingpersonalizedreports.htm" id="emailingpersonalizedreports.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Emailing personalized reports</p>
<p>Batch scheduling allows you to send personalized versions of reports to a 
list of email addresses. The addresses must be defined in a data category, the 
unique key of which is used as a blanket filter for the report. Each recipient 
receives a customized version, filtered by their unique key.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to send out a customized sales review, or a 
pre-filled tax form, or even a set of customized forms for each employee, batch 
scheduling allows you use one report for every person. This also has the benefit 
of only needing to run the report once. So you are not making repeated calls to 
the database, which could be slow and system-intensive.</p>
<p class="Warning"><strong><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.warning.png" /> WARNING</strong><br />Batch emailing 
should only be used as instructed by your administrator. If you are unsure about 
how to proceed, do not create a batch schedule. Ask your administrator for 
assistance.</p>
<p>Batch scheduling requires you to have access to a data category with a column 
of email addresses, that must be added in the report <a class="topic-link" href="reportcategories.htm">Categories</a> menu. The category does not have to 
be in the body of the report.</p>
<p>To make a batch schedule:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="list_123">
  <p>In the Schedule Report Wizard, click the <strong>Batch </strong>tab.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Select the <strong>Run as Batch Report </strong>check box.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Optional: In the <strong>To</strong> and <strong>Cc</strong> fields, enter 
  addresses to send a summary email for each completed execution.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>From the <strong>Batch Email Field </strong>list, select the data field 
  containing the email addresses for this schedule.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Optional: Click the <strong>Recipients</strong> tab to enter a subject and 
  message for the batch email.</p>
  <p>You can reference data values from the email address data row in the 
  message body. Type the parameter <span class="Code">@batch_<em>fieldname</em>@</span>, where <em>fieldname </em>is the 
  name of a data field in the address category (in 
  <strong><em>lowercase</em></strong> text). The value of the field replaces the 
  parameter text in the message output.</p>
  <p class="Tip"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.tip.png" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br />The 
  <strong>To</strong>, <strong>Cc</strong>, and <strong>Bcc</strong> fields are 
  unavailable when using Batch.</p></li></ol><span id="related-topics"></span><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
