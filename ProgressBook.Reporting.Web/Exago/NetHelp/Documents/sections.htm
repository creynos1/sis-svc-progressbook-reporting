<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>An Advanced Report's sections define the appearance and pattern of 
the report. Specifically, sections determine how frequently their cell 
contents are repeated.</p>
<p>The appearance of a report is based on data that is not 
necessarily known at the time it is made. The data, and the relationships 
it describes, are dynamic and mutable. So tabular reports are usually not fixed 
designs. Instead, you are essentially describing how the report structures 
itself around a set of unpredictable data. Knowing which sections are suitable 
for different types of content is crucial for designing the best possible 
report.</p>
<p class="Aside">Types of sections</p>
<p>There are two general types of sections: <a class="topic-link" href="sections.htm#static.htm">Static</a> and <a class="topic-link" href="sections.htm#dynamic.htm">Dynamic</a>. The difference is in the repetition 
of their cells.</p>
<p>The cells in a dynamic section repeat according to the data that is returned 
to the report. Dynamic sections are suitable for showing content related to that 
data. For example, cells in a Detail section repeat for every composite data row 
in the report. Therefore it is most suitable for data fields, of which 
you will want to see each entry per row.</p>
<p>The cells in a static section do not repeat according to the report 
data. Static sections are best used for information that is not related to data 
rows. For example, you could use a Page Header to define column headers that 
describe the type of data in each field.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><em><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.sections_static_dynamic.png" /></em></p>
<p class="Caption"><em>Static header cells used to describe the data 
in dynamic detail cells</em></p>
<p>Each section type has several subtypes that repeat in different ways. 
<em>Static </em>and <em>Dynamic </em>are only descriptive keywords. The advanced 
Report Designer does not use these terms - sections are referred to by 
their subtype.</p>
<p>See the following topics, <a class="topic-link" href="sections.htm#static.htm">Static</a> and <a class="topic-link" href="sections.htm#dynamic.htm">Dynamic</a>, for more information.</p>
<p class="Aside">Manipulating sections</p>
<p>A report can contain any variety of sections desired. To add, remove, or 
change sections, click a section title, to the left of the row numbers in the 
report grid. The section menu will appear.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.sections_menu_full.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">The section menu</p>
<p>To add a section, hover over <img alt="" src="../Media/Add2.png" /> <strong>Add Section</strong>, then choose the 
section to add. If you add a group section, choose which data category or field 
to group by.</p>
<p>To change the category or field for an existing group section, click <img alt="" src="../Media/Edit.png" /> <strong>Modify Section</strong>.</p>
<p>To change the order of sections, click <img alt="" src="../Media/MoveGridRowUp.png" /> <strong>Move Section Up </strong>or <img alt="" src="../Media/MoveGridRowDown.png" /> <strong>Move Section 
Down</strong>.</p>
<p>To delete a section, click <img alt="" src="../Media/DeleteItem.png" /> <strong>Delete Section</strong>. This will 
delete every row in the section.</p>
<p>To add alternating background colors for each row in a section, click <img alt="" src="../Media/Shading.png" /> <strong>Section Shading</strong>. See <a class="topic-link" href="sectionshading.htm">Section Shading</a> for 
details.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="static.htm" id="static.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Static<br /></p>
<p>Sections categorized as <em>static </em>do not repeat according to the data 
in the report; although they may repeat by other means. These sections are best 
used for information about the report and about the data in the report. They can 
also be useful for boilerplate elements, such as logos or disclaimers.</p>
<p>A typical report may have a report header with the title of the report, a 
page header with labels for each column, a page footer that uses the <span class="Code">@pageNumber@</span><a class="topic-link" href="formulas.htm">parameter</a> to number the pages, and a report footer with 
summary information.</p>
<p class="Aside">Page Header/Footer</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.page_sections.png" />     <img alt="" src="../Media/custom.page_sections.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Position of Page sections</p>
<p>Page sections repeat for each page - the Header at the top, the Footer 
at the bottom. Page breaks are usually caused when the data in dynamic sections 
overflows the length of a page. The length of pages is determined by the 
<strong>Page Size</strong> and <strong>Orientation</strong> lists in the Report 
<a class="topic-link" href="generaloptions.htm">General Options</a> window. The 
data on each page is consistent between the paged output types.</p>
<p>You can add page breaks manually by clicking the row number to add a break, 
then selecting <img alt="" src="../Media/PageBreak.png" /> <strong>Page 
Break</strong> from the menu. Page breaks added for a row in a dynamic 
section will make a new page every time the data changes.</p>
<p class="Tip"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.tip.png" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br />Excel and CSV output 
types have no pages. Page sections function the same as Report sections for 
these output types.</p>
<p>Use these sections for information to repeat on every page, such as the title 
of the report, column headers, and company logos. You can also use the special 
<span class="Code">@pageNumber@</span><a class="topic-link" href="formulas.htm">parameter</a> to number each page of the report.</p>
<p>Even though page sections repeat, they are not considered dynamic sections 
because their repetition does not directly depend on the data. Thus they are not 
suitable for displaying data fields. And because there is no way of knowing 
ahead of time which data will appear on which page, these sections are not 
suitable for summarizing data with aggregates or visualizations.</p>
<p class="Aside">Report Header/Footer</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.report_header.png" />     <img alt="" src="../Media/custom.report_footer.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Position of Report Header and Footer sections</p>
<p>Report header and footer sections appear once each - the Header at the 
beginning, the Footer at the end. Use these sections for introductory and 
concluding information.</p>
<p>The report footer is where you would summarize all of the report data with 
aggregate formulas and visualizations.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="dynamic.htm" id="dynamic.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Dynamic</p>
<p>Sections categorized as <em>dynamic </em>repeat according to the data in the 
report. These sections are best used for displaying and grouping data from data 
fields. Dynamic sections comprise the bulk of most tabular reports. Charts, 
maps, and gauges must reference data fields in dynamic sections.</p>
<p>The key for knowing how to use dynamic sections is knowing how the data will 
repeat in relation to the rest of the report.<br /></p>
<p class="Aside">Detail</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.detail_section.png" />     <img alt="" src="../Media/custom.detail_section.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Position of Detail section</p>
<p>The rows in the Detail section repeat for each data row retrieved from the 
database. By default, there are exactly enough Detail rows to show all the data 
fields in all the categories on the report.</p>
<p>Detail sections are typically used for showing the actual data values. This 
is the main area of display for the bare report data. Aggregate 
formulas usually reference cells in the Detail section.</p>
<p>You can use <a class="topic-link" href="reportcategories.htm#suppressingduplicatesadvancedusers.htm">duplicate 
suppression</a> to limit the number of rows to only visible data fields. You can 
also use <a class="topic-link" href="reportfilters.htm">filters</a> to limit the 
rows by certain criteria.</p>
<p>Users with advanced knowledge of the data relationships can also 
use <a class="topic-link" href="joins.htm">advanced join</a> logic to limit the 
Detail rows to only the relevant relationships.</p>
<p class="Aside">Group Header/Footer</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.group_sections.png" />     <img alt="" src="../Media/custom.group_sections.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Position of Group sections</p>
<p>Group sections are the primary way in which data is grouped into "buckets" 
that each share a unique attribute. Detail rows are arranged into the 
groups they belong to. The common attribute is defined by a preexisting sort. In 
order to make a group, first add a sort in the <a class="topic-link" href="reportsorts.htm">Sort window</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to group a set of rows by each Product, first add 
a sort on the Products.ProductName field.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.single_sort.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">A sort is required for a group</p>
<p>The main difference between the header and footer is that the data comes 
after the header, but before the footer. This means that you can only use 
aggregate formulas in the group footer, since the header is not aware of the 
data in its group.</p>
<p>When you add a group section, you are asked which sort to base the group on. 
For each sort, you can choose to group on either the sort field or the sort 
category.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="list_bullets">
  <p>If you group on a field, the group breaks at each new value of the 
  field.</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p>If you group on a category, the group breaks at each new instance of the 
  category's unique identifier.</p></li></ul>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"> <img alt="" src="../Media/screen.group_menu.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">The group window appears when adding a group section</p>
<p>For example, instead of grouping by each Product, you may want to instead 
group by product quantity, so that products that are low or out of stock are 
grouped together. First add a sort on the Products.Quantity field, then group by 
that field.</p>
<p>You can have multiple group sections, if you wanted to add additional levels 
of stratification to the report. Each group requires a corresponding sort.</p>
<p class="Tip"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.tip.png" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br />The order of the 
sorts has an effect on the way the data is arranged. Data is sorted by the first 
field, then any ambiguities are sorted by the second field, then any remaining 
ambiguities are sorted by the third, and so on. In general, you should order 
group headers by their associated sorts, and group footers in inverse order.</p>
<p class="Aside">Repeating Group</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.repeating_groups.png" />     <img alt="" src="../Media/custom.repeating_groups.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Position of Repeating Group sections</p>
<p>Repeating groups are a way to organize and display data which contains <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">multiple one-to-many relationships</span>. 
Each repeating group has data from a "many" category, grouped by the 
"one" category. The following diagrams demonstrate how this works.</p>
<p>Two categories, X and Y, with a one-to-many relationship from X to Y, 
will display like so in a Detail section.</p>
<p class="Tip"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.tip.png" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br />Category X has 
duplicates suppressed - this is similar to grouping on X.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.1M_detail.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Each X has 1 or more Y</p>
<p>If there is a third category, Z, with a one-to-many relationship from X 
to Z, there is not necessarily a relationship between Y and Z. So there may be 
blank rows with only Y or only Z.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.1Mx2_detail.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Each X has 1 or more Y, and 1 or more Z</p>
<p>There are two potential solutions. If there is a 
relationship between Y and Z, then you can use Advanced Joins to impose 
additional constraints so that only the rows with both Y and Z are shown. For 
more information, see <a class="topic-link" href="joins.htm">Joins</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there may be no relationship between Y and Z - only 
between X and Y, X and Z. Or there may be a relationship, but it does not matter 
for this data set. You can use repeating groups to ignore that relationship and 
simply organize the data by X instead.</p>
<p>To do so, create two repeating groups for X, and put Y in the first, and Z in 
the second:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.repeating_group_ex.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Organizing Y and Z into repeating groups for X</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.1Mx2_repeating_group.png" /></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><em>Each X repeats twice: once for Y, once for 
Z</em></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Each repeating group section has its own group 
header, detail, and group footer. These follow the same principles as their 
general purpose equivalents, but within the repeating groups. For example, to 
calculate aggregate data for Y for each X, use an aggregate formula in the 
footer for the repeating group with the Y data.<br /></p><span id="related-topics"></span><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
