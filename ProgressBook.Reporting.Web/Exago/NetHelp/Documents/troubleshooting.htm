<p class="MidTopic">FAQs</p>
<p><span class="Option">Why is a feature or button missing?</span></p>
<p>This feature is unavailable in your environment. Contact your administrator 
for more information.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Why are there so many tabs with the same name?</span></p>
<p>Each time you run a report, it opens a new instance of the Report Viewer. It 
is safe to close the tabs you are not using.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Why can't I edit a report?</span></p>
<p>This report is locked, or it belongs to someone else. Make a duplicate 
instead.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Why can't I run a report?</span></p>
<p>The Report Viewer is disabled. From the <a class="topic-link" href="generaloptions.htm">General Options</a> menu, see if you can enable it for 
the report. If this does not work, then you have to export the report 
instead.</p>
<p><span class="Option">I downloaded a report, but I could not view or run the 
file. Why?</span></p>
<p>If you clicked <strong>Download</strong>, then you downloaded the report 
"definition". You cannot view or run this file on your desktop. 
<strong>Export</strong> the report instead.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Why are some data fields not in the Sorts or Filters 
menu?</span></p>
<p>These data fields are unsortable or unfilterable. Try to find a substitute 
field.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Why are there so many repeated or blank rows?</span></p>
<p>There is a one-to-many join between two or more categories in the report. 
There are multiple rows joined to each data field, but you will not see the data 
in those rows if you do not have a field from that category on the report. See 
<a class="topic-link" href="reportcategories.htm#suppressingduplicatesadvancedusers.htm">Suppressing 
duplicates</a> for more information.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Why do I have a bunch of junk after my data?</span></p>
<p>The report has multiple one-to-many relationships, and there is a sort on a 
field without associated data for a number of rows. The report does not know how 
to sort these rows, so it puts them all at the bottom. You can suppress these 
rows by setting <em>Must </em>constraints in the <a class="topic-link" href="joins.htm">Joins</a> menu.</p>
<p><span class="Option">What are #E0FFE0 and similar patterns?</span></p>
<p>The six letter and number patterns that start with a pound sign (#) are 
called color codes. This code is one of the ways that computers represent 
different colors. For example, white is #FFFFFF, black is #000000, teal is 
#008080, and so on. Wherever you see a color code or color field, there is 
a picker that lets you visually select a color from a palette - this 
way you don't have to worry about the codes themselves. However, matching codes 
is a good way to match colors in different reports or in different parts of 
a report.<br class="Option" /></p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="errors.htm" id="errors.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Errors</p>
<p><span class="Option">An error has occurred. Please contact your 
administrator.</span></p>
<p>This message shows when the application is unable to determine the cause of 
an error. Save your work, then try to replicate the circumstances that led to 
the error message. Then let your administrator know what happened.</p>
<p><span class="Option">No Data Qualified for this Report</span></p>
<p>The report was not able to return any data. Either there are too many 
conflicting filters, or the chosen fields have no data. If you still want to see 
the report with no data, open the <a class="topic-link" href="generaloptions.htm">General Options</a> menu, then from the <strong>No 
Data Qualify Display Mode</strong> list select <strong>Show Report</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Session has timed out; browser page will need to be 
reloaded or browser restarted</span></p>
<p>There was an error with the web server or with your internet connection. You 
may have to refresh the page, or log out and log in again.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Report has Abended</span></p>
<p>The report is trying to use an invalid <a class="topic-link" href="executioncaching.htm">data cache</a>. To refresh the cache, edit the 
report, then click the refresh <img src="../Media/CacheInvalid.png" alt="" /> 
icon.</p>
<p><span class="Option">This report contains errors. Please review the errors, and 
click Okay to continue editing, and Cancel to close.</span></p>
<p>There are problems with this report. The file may have been corrupted, or the 
administrative settings may have changed unexpectedly. Contact your 
administrator, then try to recreate the report.</p>
<p><span class="Option">There are errors with this report, which prevents it from 
being executed or scheduled. Please edit report to view and fix 
errors.</span></p>
<p>The Chained Report is missing component reports. They may have been renamed, 
moved, or deleted. Try to locate the missing reports, then re-add them to the 
Chained Report.</p>
<p><span class="Option">Invalid template bookmark: Name; paragraphs, tables, and 
other Word objects cannot be contained within bookmark content that is mapped to 
a data field. Please see user guide for information on Word document 
templates.</span></p>
<p>You are trying to use two or more different Word based templates in the same 
Chained Report, which is not supported.</p>
<p><span class="Option">ERROR: / #VALUE!</span></p>
<p>There are problems with the formula in this cell. Check for errors such as 
missing parentheses, improper value types, or missing arguments. The <a class="topic-link" href="formulas.htm">Formula Editor</a> is helpful for 
determining formula errors.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
