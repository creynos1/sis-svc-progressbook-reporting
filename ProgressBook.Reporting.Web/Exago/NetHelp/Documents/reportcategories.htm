<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>Use this window to select which data to use on the report. The left pane 
shows the data categories you can access. To see the fields in a category, 
select it, then click the <strong>View Category Fields</strong> <img src="../Media/Information.png" alt="" /> icon.</p>
<p>If the report has a custom SQL category then it cannot have 
any other categories. You can click the <strong>SQL icon <img alt="" src="../Media/SQL.png" /> </strong>to edit the SQL statement. See <a class="topic-link" href="categoriestab.htm#sqlcategoriesadvancedusers.htm">SQL 
categories (advanced users)</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="Aside"><strong>What are data categories?</strong></p>
<p>Data categories are tables of data, which are organized by rows and columns. 
Columns are also known as <em>data fields. </em>A row of data has entries for 
one or more columns in the category. When you add a data field onto a report you 
are seeing the information in one column of data for every row in the 
category.</p>
<p>For example, a data category for <em>Employees </em>could have columns for 
the first and last names of each employee, an identification number, and a home 
phone number. Each row represents a person, and each column contains a specific 
type of information such as Last Name or Phone Number.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img src="../Media/custom.TableOfEmployees.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Example of a data category for employee records</p>
<p>You add entire categories at a time to a report, but in the report view you 
select only the columns you want to see. When you add a data field to the report 
design, even though you only see one column, the rest of the table is still 
present behind the scenes. You will never lose the connections between items in 
each row, and you can always add more fields.</p>

<p class="Aside"><strong>Relationships between categories (advanced 
users)</strong></p>
<p>In the data source, data categories are <em>joined </em>to other categories 
by associating uniquely identifying data fields from one category to matching 
data fields in another. This means that if a row's identifying field matches one 
or more rows in a joined category, then those rows connect to an entire row or 
group of rows, which have their own separate data fields.</p>
<p>Only joined data categories, which are described as having a 
<em>relation</em>, can be added to the same report. This is why some categories 
may become unavailable as you add others. But data categories, even if they are 
not related to each other, may both be related to another category. If you add 
that category, then you can add both those categories, because there is now a 
<em>join path </em>between them.</p>
<p>For more information on how categories are related to each other, see <a class="topic-link" href="joins.htm">Joins</a>.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="suppressingduplicatesadvancedusers.htm" id="suppressingduplicatesadvancedusers.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Suppressing duplicates (advanced users)</p>
<p>Be judicious when adding data categories. If you find that your report has 
unexpected duplicate values or empty rows, the cause is most likely that you 
have a one-to-many join to a category that you are not using.</p>
<p>For example, this report has Employees and Orders categories. There is a 
one-to-many join from Employees to Orders, indicating that each Employee row is 
joined to one or more Order rows. Even though we are not using Orders on 
the report design, there are duplicate Employees because our join setup causes 
us to have a row for each Order, instead of each Employee.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.reportdesigner_dynamiccell.png" />      <img alt="" src="../Media/screen.reportdesigner_onetomanyoutput.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Unexpected duplicate Employee values</p>
<p>There are several ways to eliminate these duplicates. You can suppress 
duplicates for the Employees category, which will show blank rows for 
consecutive duplicates. In the Categories window, select the <strong>Suppress 
Duplicates</strong> check box for the Employees category.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.reportdesigner_suppresscategory.png" /></p>
<p class="Caption">Duplicate-suppressed category</p>
<p>You can also suppress duplicates for the cell, which will hide 
unnecessary duplicate rows. Select the cell and click the <img alt="" src="../Media/SuppressDuplicates.png" /> <strong>Suppress Duplicates</strong> 
icon. If a field from Orders is on the report, the behavior will be the same as 
suppressing duplicates for the category.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img alt="" src="../Media/screen.reportdesigner_dynamicoutput.png" /></p>

<p>Or, if you do not think you will need the Orders category, remove it from the 
report. In the Categories window, click the <img alt="" src="../Media/DeleteItem.png" /> <strong>Delete Category</strong> icon next 
to Orders to remove the category. You can always add it again later if 
needed.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
