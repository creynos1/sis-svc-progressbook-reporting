<h1>Chained Reports</h1>
<p>Chained Reports combine multiple reports into a single multi-page document. 
They are a convenient way to bundle related reports into a format suitable for 
printing or sending to a mailing list.</p>
<p>For example, you could combine a report on total monthly sales over time, 
product sales for the month, and a report highlighting this month's top selling 
employee. And you could schedule it to be emailed regularly at the end of every 
month.</p>
<p>A benefit of Chained Reports is that, unless you want to use collation, they 
do not need to have anything in common. You could chain entirely disparate 
reports together without a problem.</p><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="makingachainedreport.htm" id="makingachainedreport.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Making a Chained Report</p>
<p>A Chained Report is basically a list of reports, and making a Chained Report 
is as simple as making a list.</p>
<p>To make a Chained Report:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="list_123">
  <p>Click the <strong>New Report <img src="../Media/MainLeftPaneNewReport.png" alt="" /> 
  </strong>icon and select <img src="../Media/NewChainedReportItem.png" alt="" /> <strong>Chained Report</strong>. 
  Enter a name for the Chained Report and select a folder where it should live. 
  It does not have to be in the same folder as the reports that it contains.</p>
  <p class="Caution"><strong><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.caution.png" /> Caution<br /></strong>A report name 
  cannot contain the following characters:<br />\ / : * ? " &lt; &gt; |</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>On the Reports page, add the reports to include in the Chained Report. 
  Supported report types are Advanced Reports, Express Reports, Crosstab 
  Reports, and ExpressViews.</p>
  <p>The order of the reports in the list is the order they will appear in the 
  output. Click the Up <img src="../Media/MoveGridRowUp.png" alt="" /> or Down <img src="../Media/MoveGridRowDown.png" alt="" /> arrows to move a report up or down in the 
  list. Click the Delete icon <img src="../Media/DeleteItem.png" alt="" /> to remove a 
  report from the list.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>Click the <strong>Save <img src="../Media/ExpressSave.png" alt="" /> </strong>icon 
  to save the Chained Report.</p></li></ol>
<p class="Aside"><strong>Note about export types</strong></p>
<p>If one of the reports cannot export to a certain file type, then the Chained 
Report cannot export to that type. All of the reports must share at least one 
export type, or else the Chained Report will have no compatible type to run as. 
Supported types are PDF, Word (RTF), CSV, and Excel (XLS).</p>
<p class="Aside"><strong>Reports with templates</strong></p>
<p><a class="topic-link" href="template.htm">Template reports</a> can be added to 
a Chained Report. The Chained Report must be exported to the same file type as 
the template. Multiple templates of the same file type can be chained together, 
with the exception of Microsoft Word based templates.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="promptingfiltersandparameters.htm" id="promptingfiltersandparameters.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Prompting filters and parameters</p>
<p>If one or more reports has prompting filters or parameters, then you can set 
rules for what should happen when the Chained Report is run.</p>
<p>To edit a report's prompting options:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="list_123">
  <p>On the Reports page, click the <strong>Report Options <img src="../Media/Edit.png" alt="" /> </strong>icon.</p>
  </li><li class="list_123">
  <p>For each prompting filter and parameter, the following options are 
  available:</p>
  <p><span class="Option">Common Prompt</span></p>
  <p class="Indent">All reports which contain this filter field or parameter will 
  use the specified value. In the <strong>Data (Prompt Text or Value) 
  </strong>field, enter the text to prompt the user for a value.</p>
  <p><span class="Option">Report Prompt</span></p>
  <p class="Indent">Only this report will use the specified value. In the 
  <strong>Data (Prompt Text or Value) </strong>field, enter the text to prompt 
  the user for a value.</p>
  <p><span class="Option">Assign Value</span></p>
  <p class="Indent">The Chained Report will not prompt for a value for this filter 
  or parameter. In the <strong>Data (Prompt Text or Value)</strong> field, enter 
  the value to use.</p></li></ol>
<p class="Tip"><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.tip.png" /> <strong>Tip</strong><br />Values for prompting 
filters and parameters cannot be set when scheduling a Chained Report. If a 
Chained Report is intended to be scheduled, use the <strong>Assign Value 
</strong>option to specify values.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="chainedreportoptions.htm" id="chainedreportoptions.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Chained Report options</p>
<p>The Options page contains the following options:</p>
<p><strong>Default Export Type</strong></p>
<p class="Indent">Select the file type to which the Chained Report will export by 
default. Available types are limited by report export restrictions, and by the 
<strong>Allowed Export Types </strong>option. HTML is not supported.</p>
<p class="Indent"><span class="Option">Default</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="Indent">Uses the environment's default export type.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Allowed Export Types</strong></p>
<p class="Indent">Select which file types the Chained Report is allowed to export 
to. You must select at least one type.</p>
<p><strong>No Data Qualified Action</strong></p>
<p class="Indent">If a report has no data, choose what to display:</p>
<p class="Indent"><span class="Option">Show Placeholder</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="Indent">Show the report without any data in it.</p></blockquote>
<p class="Indent"><span class="Option">Skip Report</span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="Indent">Show nothing, and move on to the next report.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Collate Reports on</strong></p>
<p class="Indent">Select whether to collate the Chained Report, and which data 
field to use. This option is disabled if the reports have no common data fields. 
See <a class="topic-link" href="chainedreports.htm#collatingreports.htm">Collating 
reports</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Page break after each report</strong><br /></p>
<p class="Indent">Select whether to start a new page after every report. This only 
affects PDF and RTF files.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><a class="_D2HAnchor" name="collatingreports.htm" id="collatingreports.htm"></a>
<p class="MidTopic">Collating reports</p>
<p>Collation breaks up the reports in the Chained Report by a specified <a class="topic-link" href="sortstab.htm">sort field</a>, and then groups together 
the reports by each instance of the sort. Essentially, this turns a sort field 
into a common grouping for the reports, working in much the same way a <a class="topic-link" href="sections.htm">group section</a> would. This can allow you 
to use individual reports as pieces in a composite report.</p>
<p class="Aside"><strong>Order of reports in a collated Chained 
Report</strong></p>
<p class="Indent">Report 1, filtered by group 1</p>
<p class="Indent">Report 2, filtered by group 1</p>
<p class="Indent">Report 1, filtered by group 2</p>
<p class="Indent">Report 2, filtered by group 2</p>
<p class="Indent">    and so on.</p>
<p>Some common uses for Chained Report collation include:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="list_bullets">
  <p>Grouping disparate reports by order number, or employee number, or 
  something else in common</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p>Combining mostly identical reports, only with different filters or joins, 
  into a composite report</p>
  </li><li class="list_bullets">
  <p>Making a composite report with multiples of a feature which normal reports 
  can only have one of, such as a detail section</p></li></ul>
<p class="Caution"><strong><img alt="" src="../Media/custom.caution.png" /> Caution<br /></strong>Collation is 
recommended for advanced users only.</p><span id="related-topics"></span><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
