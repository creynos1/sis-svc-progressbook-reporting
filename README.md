# Setup
### Prerequisites
1. [Master Database](https://github.com/FrontlineEducation/sis-db-gradebook-master)
2. 1 or more [District Database](https://github.com/FrontlineEducation/sis-db-gradebook-district)
3. [SIS Database](https://github.com/FrontlineEducation/sis-db-studentinformation)
3. [SpecialServices](https://github.com/FrontlineEducation/sis-app-specialservices) (database only)
4. pb_template (document pending)
5. IIS (document pending)
6. [Central](https://github.com/FrontlineEducation/sis-app-centraladmin)
7. [Student Information](httos://github.com/FrontlineEducation/sis-app-studentinformation)

### Build the Solution
Clone the sis-svc-progressbook-reporting repository

Open the ProgressBook.Reporting solution in visual studio

If not already done, setup the nuget package source in visual studio
1.	Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for Solutionâ€¦
2.	Gear icon next to package source dropdown at the top right
3.	Create a new source and name it anything
4.	Source: `https://tfs1.software-answers.com/ProgressBookCollection/_packaging/SA_Nuget/nuget/v3/index.json`
5.	Restore NuGet packages for the solution

There are config files in several projects that need to be manually copied and renamed. For example, `ProgressBook.Reporting.Web\Config\connectionStrings.config.sample` should be copied and renamed to `ProgressBook.Reporting.Web\Config\connectionStrings.config` (keep the sample file). You can use this powershell script to do it automatically
```powershell
$sampleFiles = Get-ChildItem -filter *.sample -Recurse | Select-Object FullName
$sampleFiles | ForEach-Object{   
   Copy-Item $_.FullName -Destination ($_.FullName -replace '.sample', '')
} 
```
1.	ProgressBook.Reporting.Web\Config

You should now be able to build the solution. You may need to build once in Release mode.

### Configuration

With the ProgressBook.Reporting solution open in visual studio, go to the properties of the ProgressBook\Web.ProgressBook project

Navigate to the Web tab, and in the Servers section at the bottom...
1.	Change the dropdown value to Local IIS
2.	Change the Project Url to https://(your local website)/Reporting
3.	Click Create Virtual Directory, then save

Update the ProgressBook connection string with your central database
1.	Data Source will be your SQL server name
2.	Initial Catalog will be your Central database name
3.	User Id and Password will be for your SQL user

Update the StudentInformation connection string the same way, but with the sis database instead.

Update the DistrictTemplate connection string the same way, but with the pb_template database instead.

Update the PbMasterContext connection string the same way, but with the pb_master database instead.

Update the PbMasterContext connection string the same way, but with the pb_master database instead.

Update the QuickReports connection string the same way, but with the sis database instead (use the same values as StudentInformation).

Update the SpecialServices connection string the same way, but with the special services database instead.

You will need to update these in the following locations:
1.	ProgressBook\config\connectionStrings.config

Rebuild the ProgressBook.Reporting.Web solution to make sure everything is still working.
